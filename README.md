# Toman Bike Share - Project SQL & Power BI

# Project Overview
- **Objective**: Build a database from Excel files, connect to Power BI, and create an interactive dashboard.
- **Key Metrics**: Hourly revenue analysis, profit and revenue trends, seasonal revenue, demographics.
- **Central Analysis Question**: Recommendations for raising prices next year.

# Data Analysis Workflow
1. Create Database: Use SQL Server to set up a database.
2. Develop SQL Queries: Import data, manipulate it using SQL.
3. Connect Power BI: Link the database to Power BI for visualization.
4. Build Dashboard: Create a user-friendly dashboard that meets stakeholder requirements.

We can see that :
- 25% price increase
- 64,8% increase in demand
 
-> With a 25% increase in price we see a 64% increase in demand, we can be pretty confident that if we increase the price a little more it won't affect demand (assuming everything works in a linear way)

Price elasticity is 64%/25% = 2.56, showing that when price increases, demand increases more than the rate of price increase.

***Maybe increase the price a little and monitor the market because there can be many factors affecting demand***
